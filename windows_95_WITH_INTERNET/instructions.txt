Download windows95b and windows95b.iso.uibak and put them in a folder (LINK)

If the link does not work, then you must use the normal windows 95 ISO, but you have to use UltraISO premium to extract all .cab files into a folder called FDD from the root folder in the windows 95 CD-ROM
I will be saving the forum html page in case it's lost, for instructions

So, assuming we have all the required files, we start by just booting with windows95b.iso
With a dos diskette iso containing the sources.bat file in its root directory.

Type fdisk in the terminal to create partition
Type format c: to format the C drive

type sources to copy all the files it needs into C:/FDD
Type r:

Then type setup

It's going to eventually ask for netapi.dll, this is very important. If you were able to obtain the windows95b.iso from me, then you just need to type in C:/FDD/PRECOPY2. If not, you will need to go in the windows95b.iso, and add the netapi32.dll into FDD/PRECOPY2, but renamed as netapi.dll.

FOLLOWING ALONG

mapi32.dll will be in C:/FDD/WIN95_09 no matter what. If it's not, then you can always put it in there yourself.

The rest of the files will probably be copied automatically. (I'm so sorry if they don't, this thing is really old)

LATER ON, AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN THE FORUM:

You will want to setup the network through the control panel. To do this you open it, go to network, then add a protocol TCP/IP from the microsoft provider.
It will ask for arp.exe, which is on disk 18, AKA C:/FDD/WIN95_18

It will then restart, and you're on motherbadda!!!! you are now using something epic
